      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        (random para, i know)Finding the truth wouldn't be easy, that's for
        sure. Then there was the question of whether or not Jane really wanted
        to know the truth. That's the thing that bothered her most. It wasn't
        the difficulty of actually finding out what happened that was the
        obstacle, but having to live with that information once it was found.
        Indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar
        part of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a vague
        anguish. It was like a shadow, like a mist passing across her soul's
        summer day. It was strange and unfamiliar; it was a mood. She did not
        sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband, lamenting at Fate, which
        had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken. She was
        just having a good cry all to herself. The mosquitoes made merry over
        her, biting her firm, round arms and nipping at her bare insteps. She
        didn't understand how changed worked. When she looked at today
        compared to yesterday, there was nothing that she could see that was
        different. Yet, when she looked at today compared to last year, she
        couldn't see how anything was ever the same.
